<h2>Slow cooked Traeger Brisket</h2>

<p>Say hello to bold hickory hardwood flavor. 
    This brisket is given a Traeger Beef Rub coating, 
    then smoked low and slow to tender perfection.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>1 (12-14 lb) whole packer brisket, trimmed</li>
    <li>As Needed Traeger Beef Rub</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the brisket liberally with Traeger Beef Rub, then wrap in plastic wrap. Transfer the wrapped brisket to the refrigerator and let sit for 12-24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to cook, set the Traeger temperature to 225℉ and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes. For optimal flavor, use Super Smoke, if available.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the brisket. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the meat, then place directly on the grill grates, fat-side down. Close the lid and cook until internal temperature reaches 160℉, about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the brisket from the grill and wrap in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped brisket back on the grill and cook until the internal temperature reaches 204℉, 3-4 hours more.</li>
            <li>Remove the brisket from the grill and let rest in the foil for at least 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice against the grain. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
